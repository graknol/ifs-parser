# Enumerations

Enumerations follow much the same principle as entities, but they are much simpler, due to their not-so-complex nature; to present the application with a "multiple-choice" type, which gets mapped to a VARCHAR2 or NUMBER value in the database.
These are, just like entities, XML-based files, but the developer sees a much easier representation as you can see in the *.txt files I've provided.
